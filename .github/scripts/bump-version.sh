#
# Rules (conventional commits):
#   - a "feat" commit (or a merge from a *feat* branch) since the last tag
#     bumps the MINOR version and resets PATCH (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
#   - any other change bumps PATCH (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
#   - a change that only touches documentation (docs/, README.md, AGENTS.md)
#     does NOT ship a new tag: documentation is not part of the release
#   - with no tag at all, the first feature starts the project at 0.1.0
#
# Human-readable detail is printed on the other lines.
